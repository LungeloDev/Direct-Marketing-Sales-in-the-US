# Project Report

# Accomplishments:
Phase one allowed us to gain some familiarity with Oracle and the APIs for retrieving data. We moved forward with working with the quickstats dataset.  We were able to discern the following descriptions of the data we have chosen to work with:
*Sales by Marketing Practice Datasets.*
Our aim was to find patterns on the dataset for Missouri State since St Louis falls under Missouri. The question we had in mind was "How can we help the farmers in Missouri State market their products in a benefiting way?", and with our findings we saw that they perform better when they sell directly to consumers. Their Total sales even became an outlier on the *Marketing Directly to consumers* Datset, whereas in *Marketing Directly to Retailers* and *Marketing Directly to institutions* Datasets they showed to perform bad.


# Goals for the next week of work (pre phase 2):
We will be striving to gather data in an organized method and optimize our API to pull data more efficiently. 


# Distribution of work:
We have distributed the work into four core components:
Oracle interface and utilization, data collection and consolidation, data analysis, and report generation.

Oracle interface and utilization lead: Meluleki Ngcobo
Data collection and consolidation lead: Mxolisi Khumalo
Data analysis lead/secondary: Lungelo Mpanza/ Les Bambo
Report generation lead: Snaye Sotashe
